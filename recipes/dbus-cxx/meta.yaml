# Note that while Conda accepts a package name of "dbus-c++", Anaconda.org
# rejects it.

# The original package is essentially unmaintained, buggy, and contains many
# dubious constructs. I needed to patch it a whole bunch to get it to build on
# Mac OS X, including needing to re-initialize the Autotools scripts to get
# everything to link correctly. So in the end I gave up and decided to not
# just patch up the package, but to actually fork the repository and roll my
# own little release.
